Who does that? They dont control their crowd. Many times I've gone I've seen fights. The bartenders suck - I've almost got in a fight with one because she was a complete bitch. Refused to serve me a drink because she was busy celebrating her friends birthday BEHIND THE BAR. This place is ridiculous. I will NEVER go there again.. EVER.,2,msQe1u7Z_XuqjGoqhB0J5g

So I know a little about the almighty doughnut. I was there this past Thursday night at Westgate where I was having a nice dinner at Opah Life. I wanted a little desert so I went to this doughnut shop it seemed clean enough so I made my selections and took them home. Mistake should have eaten one there I would have ask for my money back. I took a bite out of each on to confirm what I thought they were the worst doughnuts I have ever had. Horrible not sure if the oils was rancid or not hot enough either way eat at your own risk.,0,Fc_nb6N6Sdurqb-rwsY1Bw

My friend and went there for dinner we were seated quickly unfortunately it was in middle of the empty dinning room so we asked to be moved to the side which we were. Upon sitting down we were told we could only have one of the very small table tops there were two together so the hostess told us the manager said we couldn't use two table tops in the empty restaurant. So we got up and left. With the manager chasing us blaming the hostess for the the ridiculous action. Needles to say we will never return.,1,Fc_nb6N6Sdurqb-rwsY1Bw

744,07F9bkUm3cs83CzGvTi0TA,1,2015-03-15,0,wgr_hOfIWlXR-glOC-qKYQ,5,Kudos to Charlotte Motor Speedway!! They took a situation that was less than idea at the All Star Race and turned it into a customer service win. Here is what happened. I used Ticketmaster to buy 6 tickets to the All Star Race. I browsed a few sections then wound up buying tickets in Chrysler section K. When we arrived at our section we were informed that it was a no alcohol section. I didn't remember seeing anything on the website (i went back and looked and there was at the checkout page and because of the way I searched I missed the one on the main page) or on my tickets. I was told to go exchange my tickets the gate. The employees at gate 3 said they did not have access to the Ticketmaster system so I would have to go to gate 4. At this point I'm not pleased but I head to gate 4. I show the employee my tickets on my phone and he hands in over to someone else. After about 20 or 30 minutes I'm informed by someone who I assume is a supervisor that the usher is wrong and that our tickets are not in an alcohol free zone and there is no need to exchange them and that the map displayed in the window of the ticket booth showing this as an alcohol free zone was wrong and out of date. At this point we have missed about a 1/4 of qualifying. We head back to our seats and inform the usher that we were told that it was ok to drink here. He said absolutely not and that the ticket person was wrong. At this point I'm furious. So we walk down into the next section and head toward the bottom to find some open seats and hope we are not sitting in someone else's seats (luckily we weren't as most of them around us filled up). Upon calling the ticket office today and explaining what happened the agent said I did miss the no alcohol writing at the checkout page but offered me 6 tickets to next years race to make up for the inconvenience!!! Way to go CMS even though we regularly attend races here you now have a customer for life!,1,Cxv3SNudPrCavvHJfIbwhQ

The 2 stars is because they no longer have limes!(trying to get a response) I ordered a margarita (ultimate which was very good) and when I asked for a lime the bartender said they had stopped ordering them because they were too expensive! Now granted this didn't make or break my meal but that was one of the strangest things I have heard. It wasn't like it was $2 margarita night ($9 to be exact) Hopefully someone in management will see this and respond. If you like a lime with your margarita or your Mexican beer you may want to pass until they they make a better business decision,2,Cxv3SNudPrCavvHJfIbwhQ

Can't say enough good things about advantage not pushy in anyway nice and quick will be taking my car to them for now on. And I will be telling friends and family about them. Thanks again guys!,0,o0cJ-VrzTYM2HuS8y-yRLw

I go to cancel my account (a month before I move) and I was told to bring all bottles and dispenser in before March 1st. I returned all bottles and dispenser on Feb. 23rd. I was given a receipt that said my account was closed and current. Today I get a bill for $30 and they say I have 5 bottles to return still!? Are you kidding me? You looked at my account on Feb. 23 and cleared it! Took 30mins on hold to get customer service and was just told that she sent an email and a response would take 3 days. If THEY determine I somehow have these mystery bottles of water that I never received I will not be refunded. AVOID THIS SERVICE! TRUST ME. Everything about closing the account was (and still is) a nightmare. Do yourself a favor and do business with someone else! Some of the WORST customer service I have seen in Las Vegas to date. Shame of businesses that know they are below standards and continue to operate without making changes to provide better service.

I wanted acrylic but apparently acrylic sounds like UV gel with shellac.  They started with acrylic tips and I'd never had gel before so I didn't know what they were doing until it was too late.  Wasn't pleased with the gel nails either - super thick and they were totally skimpy with the nail colour.  I will never again get gel nails and I certainly won't be back where I don't get what I asked for in the first place.  They completely ignored what I asked for and put the most expensive nail service they have on me.  It wasn't until I paid that I knew exactly what service I had received.

We went on a Sunday afternoon and it just us and like a couple of other tables so they were not busy at all and the service was so incredibly slow and bad. Our appetizer and the kids meal we ordered came out pretty fast but then we literally waited for like 30 minutes for our food which we learned later was just sitting under the heat lamps for like 15 minutes. There were like 3 servers hanging around not busy while our food just sat there. And our server was hanging out at a table sitting with them for like 10 minutes when our food was just sitting there. Finally we got up and asked where our food was and it still took another 5 or so minutes for someone to bring it. The tacos were soggy by this time and not good. Aside from the bad service the food was just a total let down. The kids meal was gross and our tacos were soggy and it seems the oil was old because everything fried had a bad taste to it.

We had a very bad experiance and ended up leaving because of the rude service. We were a small group and we are obviously different looking than the crowd in the restaurant. The servers at the bar where very rude and no one offered to take our order or seat us. Then there was an open booth near the front and we asked to sit at that table and one of the servers told us that it was taken even though no one was sitting there. Like 10 minutes later a white couple came in and they offered the booth to them. We finally realized that there was a back room with empty tables and we went and seated ourselves and literally waited for 15 minutes before anyone even walked over to our table to ask for our drinks. They saw us seat ourselves which is why we finally got the hint that we were not welcome and got up and left. I think unless your a local in the neighborhood I would not visit this place.

It's really good to go with a bunch of people that you can try all the kebabs.  Been to all their locations and the meat is always fresh and tasty and consistently good.  Their quality and freshness is definitely higher than some of the other kebab options in the area.  Highly recommended.  It's also great for people who are New to different ethnic foods as this is relatively mild and you can add as much spice as you want on the side as needed.  :),0,K5TZLIfO4JXhXHiNd0-REA

She came across wonderfully in my initial meeting with her but things quickly went downhill. She showed up at my wedding with a friend that she claimed was her second photographer but I don't think that friend took any pictures. My bridesmaids later told me that Leah was saying she didn't even want to be there...I paid her plenty of money to be there! I had to beg her for pictures after a few months and then got about 100 less than what was promised in the contract. Oh and no reception pictures! I don't have a single picture of me dancing with my husband or father. I asked her about this and she came up with excuse after excuse. Finally after 8 months and the threat of a lawsuit she admitted she didn't have any pictures from the reception. Leah has changed her company name so many times (I'm sure due the bad reviews) and it makes me so mad that she's still out there duping people. Please do not do business with her!,2,Ax0GGDPECKMQqwwlyp23xw

First was an employee wouldn't let a mom in front of me in line exchange a pair of kids shoes for a smaller size. She didn't have a receipt but all she was asking to do was get a smaller size. She ended up leaving in tears and the employee did nothing to help her. Second experience was we bought a lawn mower in 2014 and got the extended 3 year warranty. The sales associate assured us that if we canceled within the 3 year time frame we would get 100% of the warranty price back. Well here it is almost 3 years later and Sears will only refund $44 of the $249 price of the warranty. So the sales associate just lied to our face and management will do nothing to refund the full $249. Never shopping here again.,0,rbFG2hvQPA0Vca2cBGomFQ

Came a day before they opened and the lady at the cash was so friendly and welcoming. Came two days later and was not greeted at all. There was no way to tell where to order ...the guy near the food just looked at me with wide eyes. I asked for a mix plate (chicken n beef) he cuts the beef and asks me about my salad n rice choice. He adds the salad to the main part of the takeout container which is usually meant for rice. As for the rice..he litteraly gave me 3 regular size spoon fulls. Then adds the beef...i told him its mixed plate. He doesnt aknowledge. Removes some of the beef that already has tahini sauce on it and adds some chicken. I go to pay and the cashier is on his phone texting and i was visible to him. I ask if this is where i pay and he says yes and apologizes...i gave him a 20 and later realized he overcharged me by $3. The food taste was good but i would never go back. A new restaurant should embrace new customers and win them over forever. Interested to see how others were treated,3,2McB9CmWgZFlGWQozt6sOA

2213,IPiRBDgjSFGOZeewrAVIMQ,0,2013-01-17,2,KLadJayf6GSCe0rxPbtuCA,5,I find the last review (Riki L.) Very comical. I happen to be in the store the day she came in trying to pick up her table on that Sunday. Her paperwork clearly said Monday and she had the wrong day. In fact I had to stop getting customer service so they could help her. She was yelling through the store and cussing at them using profanity I had my children in there. Total white trash is how she acted. I had to stay in the store until after they closed because of her stunt going over to the other store. She went to pick up her table at the 59th Ave. and Bell location she put it in her truck and she left and never paid for.  The owners daughter on the E. Bell Rd. location called her several times as I was sitting right in front of her. Rik never picked up her phone. I would say in the 15 minutes before she called the police she had to have called for probably 10 times. She knew she owed the money when she loaded the table she should have paid for it then. Howie world was left with nothing left but to call the police to protect themselves. I have never seen someone in my life be so rude to people in a store as this Riki was. Howie world was not rude to her or mean to her. She wanted them to deliver something on a different day and hour before closing. And it simply could not have been done. Riki Did not read her paperwork for the delivery date she messed up and she wanted them to take the blame for it And she drove the other location picked up the merchandise and didn't pay for. You never know who's watching who's going to read these reviews it truly helps to be honest!,0,N3QcinahcFMvE3b1qcmmrw

I never once felt as if he was too busy for me eventhough he had a pavked lot of people. I test drove two of his suv's he had on the lot and decided right then and there. He ran credit on me and bam we were rolling. Gave me different payment options and scenarios all while staying honest and even standing his ground a little when negotiations came:). I like that about him. It was fair. I got what i wanted at the payment i wanted. Period. No hassel no hidden anything very professional. He even stayed lateer than usual to make sure i was satisfied with my purchase being the night nefore valentines day needless to say his wife im sure wasnt happy about this..lol but he took the wifely lashing so to speak to make sure i was taken care of and happy. Being scared of car dealerships and salesmen..Brady is a glimpse into how my grand daddy use to say car deals went. U go in tell em what u want and they made it happen and u were happy.

So on mothers day I decided to try out the new location via carryout. I called twice and got hung up on twice. I called back a third time to raise a complaint with the manager about the host Danielle ( who clearly doesn't want to do her job). The manager stuck up for Danielle saying that she was a sweet girl and that she would never do that. In the process pretty much telling me he doesn't care about our business. He could not have cared less and took no ownership. It'll be a while if ever I go back here.,0,lVT_7-AR7MTWg9SHDLpEZg

It's a okay place to grab a drink and their fish and chips is pretty decent but the service and some of the other things off the menu is a gamble. I've given it a try several times and there have been times when everything has been good and times when everything has been bad. So unfortunately on my last experience is what will be cited most. We ended up with 3 different waitresses taking orders from us (weird) and NEVER  order the crunchy chicken sandwich. The first one came our and I took a bite which was just bread I then opened it up to find that I had scared the chicken into the furthest corner of the bun. It was literally the size of 2 quarters and that's generous. The good news was they apologized and had another one ordered right away. The fries were good though.,0,uK0LdXjF93PuPzVgo-Jsgg

I went to get a cut today and it seems to me the consistency for the dedication to quality is not across the board. As a business owner Tony your employees are a direct reflection of you and exuberate your persona. A customer looks for consistency not only in the barber but in the barber shop as well. I asked the employee who cut my hair today to read the shape of my head. It appears this was a difficult task due to the fact that when I got home and looked at the work she had done nearly half of the top portion of my head was cut down to a one!!! The rest of it top portion had some length to it making my head look like it was completely butchered! A cut is suppose to be faded as it moves up to the crown of the head and from there should be well blended. The top of my head looks like a deformity because this person was not paying attention and did not take the time to provide great customer service. A barber should take pride in their work and take their time and know with out a doubt what they are going to do and communicate with the customer so that both parties are on the Same fucking page. How hard is that?! I will no longer be coming here as my confidence is shot in this place after today. I would recommend that you save yourself the trouble of coming here and do the same!!,0,fUax-EYu7F9UpJ7BXXrhmg

My manicurist didn't dry my feet or legs before putting lotion on and didn't provide the full service. The lady next to me had got stones and a nice leg massage... needless to say I did not revive that and my callous is still very visible. My manicure was a complete disaster. My nails were not fully painted and the manager just told me to come back whenever I want to get it fixed. He didn't bother to really take a look or apologize. I will not be refunding.

And I really like the massage therapy after the chiro session!  She has an excellent and caring staff and I highly recommend Four Peaks Chiropractic.,0,nj9vFayHV1E5y5IDlfhtsQ

3757,_7wj87KZspahqDHxbXreMQ,0,2016-01-07,0,wY57KaKMXWpjqbaeilkUgQ,1,The pharmacist at this Walgreens is extremely rude and unprofessional. She was trying to play doctor and she is not a doctor she is a fucking pharmacist.  This women had the audacity to question my family's intent and our doctors education. We have been loyal customers of Walgreens for 15 YEARS!!! I understand their policies and we weren't asking them for special treatment. We were merely asking if it would be possible to get a certain prescription on a certain day because of the holidays. She questions our doctors integrity who has also been our family doctor for 15 years! We usually use a different Walgreens and the reason we were using this location was because the other one didn't have our prescription in stock so they referred us to them. Our other Walgreens knows us by name and they are all very sweet. This pharmacist then begins to insult the other location to us (the CUSTOMER). She also says that our doctor who has been prescribing the same thing for the 15 years is wrong and he shouldn't be prescribing that to us. She said that wouldn't fill our prescription. Feeling so insulted we then proceeded to call the corporate office and they said they would have someone call us that was in our district. They still have not returned our call. Overall i think that this pharmacist should have some repercussions for her attempt to play god.,0,xU2DZktxrJIjthxUTpk_NA

Not cool at all!!! The plumber got tied up so it ended up that both plumber and electricIan came at same time. Duanne Askew the electrician was terrific and finished the job off with a fair price as the lights I picked were not the easiest to install. Plumber was fine but could not give me a quote as the sink I had chosen was not the right size. Said to just call him when I got correct one and he would give me a quote. Since then haven't heard from him at all even though I have left several messages. For me the expierence has been less than satisfactory and I think they only want to do large projects even though their advertising implies that small jobs are top of mind. Will not use again.

Server was just ok. Never checked on us once to refill drinks until we were ready to leave. Probably because we didn't order beer. Wings were excellent. We ordered dry rub with 2 sides of sauce. Hubby's burger (Thick Rick) and fries were delicious - enough for 3 people! STAY AWAY from the Bay of Pigs Cuban pork sandwich. It was nothing like the sandwich described by the PD food editor. Unless you like 80% fat and gristle. It was gross... I'd definitely come back but stick with a burger or chicken sandwich.,1,GvjexZRFBYiqNzOmoKHRTg

Not only did they give great service they were entertaining and fun to talk to! Both Tiana and Jay or T and J ( which is what they told me to call them) addressed me by my first name the entire night instead of sir or Mr which gave very friendly vibes. They made sure my drink was always full and that I was satisfied with everything I ordered. I will definitely be back and am sitting at the bar again even if I had other people with me.

I called Rodeo and gave the sales manager the specifics on what we were looking for. But I also stated we were not 100 per cent sure. There was no pressure. Three days later we picked up the exact car we wanted no hassle what so ever.

Before their move to the new facility in Chandler they performed well for me but now they seem very comfortable and boarding on arrogance with the limited choices available to BMW owners.  What is most disturbing about their attitude was a lack of interest in determining a solution to the problem of a safety critical component of the car.

The server came across as if we were bothering her.  All her attention was on the 6 top next to us.  The food itself was alright once we got it.  We basically had to trip the server to get her to give us enough attention to ask for the check.  It surprisingly took no time to get our money but she got no tip from me.,0,BxdgakJg40DnngWpnV6JxQ

I did a ton of research and talking to people about the best pool company in our area.  Hands down, Presidential was the top recommendation.  We met with John at the Gilbert location and he was very patient with us.  We had an idea on our pool design but had no idea at all on costs.  We explained this and he patiently designed our pool and all the bells and whistles.  Obviously it came back way over what we could afford.  But John didn't give us any attitude at all.  We were even in his office right before they were closing and he didn't shoo us out the door.  We ended up taking the quote home and sitting on it for a month.  When we finally came back, John was eager to help us redesign something that we could be proud of.  And we did!!

What seemed to be a quiet Saturday evening when we first arrived at 7pm, quickly turned into a fairly busy club like dining experience. And Everest is certainly dressed to impress. The restaurant feels both sexy and modern, with dark mood lighting, clean lines, comfortable and cozy booth seating, and an eclectic playlist/DJ, depending on what night you are in. With a great view of Queen West for people watching, and MuchMusic across the street, the atmosphere, music and style of the restaurant blend in perfectly with the locals.

I sat at the bar because I came in alone so I didn't want to take up a table. After about a minute of me sitting down I realized I made a good choice! The bartenders working were AMAZING! Not only did they give great service they were entertaining and fun to talk to! Both Tiana and Jay or T and J ( which is what they told me to call them) addressed me by my first name the entire night instead of sir or Mr which gave very friendly vibes. They made sure my drink was always full and that I was satisfied with everything I ordered. I will definitely be back and am sitting at the bar again even if I had other people with me. GREAT FOOD even better service! But like I said I recommend sitting at the bar area and ask for T and J!,1,u93hjvj7b_hGU5veNE5Elw

Ok. First off, this is a pretty cool restaurant. Besides the obviously brilliant name, littlefish is a great little place to grab weekend brunch. It's small, only about 8 tables or so, but that just makes it all-the-more cozier and comfortable. It's a long, narrow space filled with exposed red brick and shiny metal airducts. The daily specials, scrawled and displayed on a suspended chalkboard, are imaginative, original, and well-thought-out.

You are pretty safe ordering most of the items on the menus, except for the mushroom soup. I was under the impression that it was a cream of mushroom soup, but it was far from what I had expected. It was more sour and strange, so I couldn't finish it. Before I ordered, I did ask to confirm that it was cream of mushroom soup, but upon tasting, I think that it had more of a wine base than cream base.

On to the most important thing, which were the steaks. My friends ordered the 16oz Ribeye, 16oz New York Strip, 12oz Hanger and I had the grade 8 12oz wagyu beef skirt steak. They were all really, really good but I have mixed feelings here. Sure, they were cooked perfectly, but I can do that at home on my grill. No sauces here, nothing; just pure steak goodness. It was my first time ordering the wagyu beef, and it was good, but I actually preferred the Hanger of the four steaks we ordered.

It tastes ok...not terrible but no seasoning to it. I like the A.&W.'s onion rings the best. Crispy and firm at most A&W's. Peter's were simple and bland. Maybe a bit like back in the 50's?  The burger was ok; it looked to be put together as an after thought and squished. The good thing is the variety milkshake flavours. That was what I was into; but for me; the milkshakes didn't have enough of that dairy/ice cream flavour for me. It was good but not giving me a wow factor. It didn't taste like real ice cream shake to me. I won't rave about it but don't hate it there. It's not a place I would want to go as top thing to do when in the area.

So they gave us an upgradewe walk into a dirty room where the beds weren't made and towels left on the floor of the bathroom. So of corse we walk back to the front desk ask for a clean room. They gave us one just down the hall. As we lay on our bed we hear burn outs in the parking lot and now the building smells like burnt rubber. Mixed with the smoke and musty smell. I complained to the front desk and I was told I think the regulars are working on a car. At midnight mind you.  I look out side my window and they are tack welding and grinding out side.

They're great with coupons; you'll almost never pay full price for a haircut.  This explains why I got my haircut there so many times.  Each visit was more bizarre than the time before.  The last time that I went to Dean's, two of the stylists lectured me on the 'bad' product that I used on my hair (a bumble and bumble product...).

They took a situation that was less than idea at the All Star Race and turned it into a customer service win. Here is what happened. I used Ticketmaster to buy 6 tickets to the All Star Race. I browsed a few sections then wound up buying tickets in Chrysler section K. When we arrived at our section we were informed that it was a no alcohol section. I didn't remember seeing anything on the website (i went back and looked and there was at the checkout page and because of the way I searched I missed the one on the main page) or on my tickets. I was told to go exchange my tickets the gate. The employees at gate 3 said they did not have access to the Ticketmaster system so I would have to go to gate 4. At this point I'm not pleased but I head to gate 4. I show the employee my tickets on my phone and he hands in over to someone else. After about 20 or 30 minutes I'm informed by someone who I assume is a supervisor that the usher is wrong and that our tickets are not in an alcohol free zone and there is no need to exchange them and that the map displayed in the window of the ticket booth showing this as an alcohol free zone was wrong and out of date. At this point we have missed about a 1/4 of qualifying. We head back to our seats and inform the usher that we were told that it was ok to drink here. He said absolutely not and that the ticket person was wrong. At this point I'm furious. So we walk down into the next section and head toward the bottom to find some open seats and hope we are not sitting in someone else's seats (luckily we weren't as most of them around us filled up). Upon calling the ticket office today and explaining what happened the agent said I did miss the no alcohol writing at the checkout page but offered me 6 tickets to next years race to make up for the inconvenience!!! Way to go CMS even though we regularly attend races here you now have a customer for life!,1,Cxv3SNudPrCavvHJfIbwhQ

2213,IPiRBDgjSFGOZeewrAVIMQ,0,2013-01-17,2,KLadJayf6GSCe0rxPbtuCA,5,I find the last review (Riki L.) Very comical. I happen to be in the store the day she came in trying to pick up her table on that Sunday. Her paperwork clearly said Monday and she had the wrong day. In fact I had to stop getting customer service so they could help her. She was yelling through the store and cussing at them using profanity I had my children in there. Total white trash is how she acted. I had to stay in the store until after they closed because of her stunt going over to the other store. She went to pick up her table at the 59th Ave. and Bell location she put it in her truck and she left and never paid for.  The owners daughter on the E. Bell Rd. location called her several times as I was sitting right in front of her. Rik never picked up her phone. I would say in the 15 minutes before she called the police she had to have called for probably 10 times. She knew she owed the money when she loaded the table she should have paid for it then. Howie world was left with nothing left but to call the police to protect themselves. I have never seen someone in my life be so rude to people in a store as this Riki was. Howie world was not rude to her or mean to her. She wanted them to deliver something on a different day and hour before closing. And it simply could not have been done. Riki Did not read her paperwork for the delivery date she messed up and she wanted them to take the blame for it And she drove the other location picked up the merchandise and didn't pay for. You never know who's watching who's going to read these reviews it truly helps to be honest!,0,N3QcinahcFMvE3b1qcmmrw

The rustic style pizzas do remind me more of true Italian pizza than one would normally expect of a North American pizza joint. The name Magpie, after the bird, is a very commonwealth reference, which may seem odd at first. It is, however, one of a number of restaurants with British references that have opened in the past year or so in Montreal: e.g. Sparrow, Lawrence, Brit & Chips, the Burgundy Lion, etc.

Came a day before they opened and the lady at the cash was so friendly and welcoming. Came two days later and was not greeted at all. There was no way to tell where to order ...the guy near the food just looked at me with wide eyes. I asked for a mix plate (chicken n beef) he cuts the beef and asks me about my salad n rice choice. He adds the salad to the main part of the takeout container which is usually meant for rice. As for the rice..he litteraly gave me 3 regular size spoon fulls. Then adds the beef...i told him its mixed plate. He doesnt aknowledge. Removes some of the beef that already has tahini sauce on it and adds some chicken. I go to pay and the cashier is on his phone texting and i was visible to him. I ask if this is where i pay and he says yes and apologizes...i gave him a 20 and later realized he overcharged me by $3. The food taste was good but i would never go back. A new restaurant should embrace new customers and win them over forever. Interested to see how others were treated,3,2McB9CmWgZFlGWQozt6sOA

At the server's recommendation we tried the Pulled Pork Nachos. What came was a healthy portion topped with a mound of pork and all the normal nacho toppings. Tasty, but not remarkable in any way, and the amount of topping-less dead space at the bottom was quite disappointing. Hot wings soon appeared followed by a number of comments of: 'Okay', 'Not stellar', 'Not that spicy'. Following another suggestion, my Axis Club sandwich soon arrived. A Pub staple, the clubhouse has almost as many variations as there are pubs. This club was well prepared, but again not remarkable. Combining chicken breast, ham and bacon on whole wheat bread it was pretty standard, much like what you'd find in a veteran diner or truck stop.

It's amazing how with every patient they kind of have a check list of the same questions and although repetitive you never heard it in their tone.

The lady next to me had got stones and a nice leg massage... needless to say I did not revive that and my callous is still very visible. My manicure was a complete disaster. My nails were not fully painted and the manager just told me to come back whenever I want to get it fixed. He didn't bother to really take a look or apologize. I will not be refunding.

 I called ahead of time, gave my details , a $77 quote and they reserved a room for me. When I arrived  the room was already reserved and I was led straight in. I initially thought I was going to have a great experience because of the quick room preparation but BOY was I wrong. When I was led into the room that was prepared, there was water all over the floor and the front desk lady hastily used paper towels to clean it up. I waited the standard 30 minutes in the smelly room until the nurse came into to check details, run temperature and give my dog a general physical. Then she left for AN HOUR. By this time it  was already 3:35, and my dog was whining from pain and discomfort in a closed off room. When the nurse returned and began to write down symptoms, my dog actually started peeing on floor. I didn't know what to do because I had no cleaning materials with me, so the nurse stepped into action and dropped a few paper towels on the ground. She didn't manage to soak up all the urine, so when she moved around, my dog was pushed into it and it ended all over my clothes when she asked for my to carry my dog onto the checkup table.
As I continued to ask questions to make sure what my dog had, the nurse seemed to reply with more things to run up my medical bill. She gave my dog a unnecessary skin scrape for mites TWICE even though SHE SAID that it didn't seem like my dog had mites, she performed and charged me for the scrape all the same. Because I had never needed to have these operations performed, I did not know that it was an extra $30 to have skin scraped. She went to look at the scrapes under the microscope, and returned another hour later. By this time, it was 5:30 and my patience was running low. For three hours, I sat in a stuffy room, covered in urine and staring at my miserable dog scratching his skin to bloody scabby bits as the doctors and nurses neglected the both of us. Honestly, I was so frustrated, I didn't even know what to do.  I had never experienced such a horrible medical visit.
